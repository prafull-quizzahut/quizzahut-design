Product Development Process:

1. Idea generation (Ideation)

It’s a good idea to consider the following factors when initiating a new product concept:

Target market: Our Target market is students who are preparing for MCQ based competitive exams.

Existing products: Adda247, Sanfoundry, IndiaBIX, ExamVeda, TestBook, 

Functionality: 
                Roles: 
                    1. Students: Those who attempt and create the quizzes
                    2. Moderators: Those who moderate the website against spam and irrelevant content
                
                Feartures:
                    1. Karma System: Karma Based Sorting (Reddit)

SWOT analysis: 
    Strength: The addition of ease of adding new questions by the students themselves makes this a democratic platform where the Quizzes are created by the students for the students.
    Weakness: Whole product is dependent on students.
    Oppoturnity: Untapped market and strong differentiator. Coaching Classes might be paying customers for this product as it will make a good playground for their students to practice.
    Threats: If students loose interest and post few questions, site becomes unusable. We need to plan AI to add new questions from provided subjects.

SCAMPER method: [We will prepare this after primary POC is developed.] (substituting, combining, adapting, modifying, putting to another use, eliminating, or rearranging)

2. Product definition

During this stage, it’s important to define specifics including:

Business analysis: There is a certain need of test conducting websites which is completely operated by students. Other players in the same market have lots of offerings for paid quizzes and test series but there is no open source or truly student own product where students can help each other to prepare better for the competitive exams.

Value proposition: The student owned nature of the product makes it more connected to the determination of the student to prepare and solve maximum number of questions to get accustomed to the topic of study. 

Success metrics: Our most primary success matrix is the user satisfaction as provided by the students through feedbacks. Number of students is not a metric we are targeting after. Rather Questions solved + Questions Added per user is more relevant metric for our use case.

Marketing strategy: We are relying on word of mouth and refrerals for this product

3. Prototyping

We are planning to prototype with following set of features:

    1. Authentication: Students and other users should be able to authenticate using their socials/mobile numbers.
    2. Quiz Attempts: Students should be able to attempts various quizzes that they have access to.
    3. Quiz Creation: Students should be able to create questions and quizzes which are categorized in subject catagories and subjects are further catagorized in exam catagories.


*Feasibility analysis: The next step in the process is to evaluate your product strategy based on feasibility. Determine if the workload and estimated timeline are possible to achieve. If not, adjust your dates accordingly and request help from additional stakeholders.

*Market risk research: It’s important to analyze any potential risks associated with the production of your product before it’s physically created. This will prevent the product launch from being derailed later on. It will also ensure you communicate risks to the team by documenting them in a risk register. 

*Development strategy: Next, you can begin working through your development plan. In other words, know how you’ll be assigning tasks and the timeline of these tasks. One way you can plan tasks and estimate timeline is by using the critical path method. 

MVP: A quiz application where students can create accounts and create quizzes. These quizzes will be attempted by other students. Upon attempting, students can upvote/downvote the quiz and question (at two levels). Moderators can control the content to avoid spam and irrelevant material. Students can view their previously attempted questions and quizzes. Students can see the results of their quizzes.

5. Validation and testing
To go live with a new product, you first need to validate and test it. This ensures that every part of the product—from development to marketing—is working effectively before it’s released to the public.

To ensure the quality of your product, complete the following:

Concept development and testing: You may have successfully designed your prototype, but you’ll still need to work through any issues that arise while developing the concept. This could involve software development or the physical production of the initial prototype. Test functionality by enlisting the help of team members and beta testers to quality assure the development. 

Front-end testing: During this stage, test the front-end functionality for risks with development code or consumer-facing errors. This includes checking the ecommerce functionality and ensuring it’s stable for launch.

Test marketing: Before you begin producing your final product, test your marketing plan for functionality and errors. This is also a time to ensure that all campaigns are set up correctly and ready to launch. 

Once your initial testing is complete, you’re ready to begin producing the final product concept and launch it to your customer base. 

6. Commercialization
Now it’s time to commercialize your concept, which involves launching your product and implementing it on your website. 

By now, you’ve finalized the design and quality tested your development and marketing strategy. You should feel confident in your final iteration and be ready to produce your final product. 

In this stage you should be working on:

Product development: This is the physical creation of your product that will be released to your customers. This may require production or additional development for software concepts. Give your team the final prototype and MVP iterations to produce the product to the correct specifications. 

Ecommerce implementation: Once the product has been developed and you’re ready to launch, your development team will transition your ecommerce materials to a live state. This may require additional testing to ensure your live product is functioning as it was intended during the previous front-end testing phase. 

Your final product is now launched. All that’s left is to measure success with the initial success metrics you landed on.
